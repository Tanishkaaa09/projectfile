🛒 Market Basket Analysis with Customer Segmentation
This project performs Market Basket Analysis using the Apriori algorithm and explores customer behavior through classification and clustering techniques. The goal is to discover product associations, predict customer spending habits, and segment customers based on their buying patterns.

📁 Dataset
Input: Market Basket Analysis.csv
Field Used: aisle – representing product categories or items.
Simulated Data: 500 customer transactions generated by randomly sampling aisles.

Generates association rules using support ≥ 0.05 and confidence ≥ 0.3.
Helps identify item combinations commonly purchased together.
Customer Classification
Labels customers as High Spenders (purchased > 4 items) or Low Spenders.
Logistic Regression model trained to predict spending category.
Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, Confusion Matrix.
Customer Segmentation (Clustering)
Applies K-Means clustering to group customers based on their aisle preferences.
