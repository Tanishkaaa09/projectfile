This project demonstrates market basket analysis and customer segmentation using simulated transaction data. It employs the Apriori algorithm to identify frequent itemsets and association rules, revealing relationships between purchased items. A logistic regression model classifies customers as high or low spenders based on the number of items bought. Finally, K-Means clustering segments customers based on their aisle preferences, providing insights for targeted marketing and inventory management. The code uses libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Mlxtend, and Scikit-learn for data manipulation, analysis, and modeling.
